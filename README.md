#What is RollingTimer
Rolling Timer is actually a Linux system backup application. It is written specially for Neokylin system, which is the product of the company I'm working for.

For the sake of the company's characteristic, I could make it open source without breaking any rules. But rough as it is, the reason I publish it is I need to work on multiple machines.

Surly it has huge room to refine, and no warranty for your data when playing it around.
